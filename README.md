Documentation and data of "How Faster Trains Draw Chinaâ€™s Cities Ever Closer"

1. Data files

"raw data" contains raw data (as its name suggests:P). Seriously, it contains the departing times and arriving times, as well as the exact sources. The "note" column is for cities that were not directly connected to Beijing, either unconnected completely, or for some cities, at least one transfer is needed. 

"matrix" only contains travel times from Beijing to these cities by year and region.

2. How do we decide which train to choose?

There are often multiple trains that travel between Beijing and these cities. We chose the fastest direct train if possible. If not, the fastest indirect way.

3. Where did we get the sources?

Shanghai library and online second-hand bookstore.
