Documentation and data of "How Faster Trains Draw Chinaâ€™s Cities Ever Closer"

1. Data files

"raw data" contains raw data (as its name suggests:P). Seriously, it contains the departing times and arriving times, as well as the exact sources. The "note" column is for cities that were not directly connected to Beijing, either unconnected completely, or for some cities, at least one transfer is needed. 

"matrix" only contains travel times from Beijing to these cities by year and region.
